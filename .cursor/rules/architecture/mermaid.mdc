## Mermaid Diagrams Tips

### ✅ DO
- Create a Markdown file for each Database
- Create a seperate diagram for each database schema
- Create a Folder for each project in the `docs\` folder
- Create a Folder for each root namespace in the project's doc folder
- Create a file for each leaf namespace in the root namespace doc folder
- Create a Markdown file for each Class in the leaf namespace folder
- Create Mermaid diagrams and documentation for the Class in the Class Markdown file

### ❌ DON'T
- Unless requested, do not create diagrams in the root of the project repository. Always add docs to the `docs\` folder
- Update diagrams unless requested by the user
- Update code from diagrams unless requested by the user

## Property Translation rules:
- Nullable C# properties such as `public DateTime? PropertyName {get; set; }` should be translated into a nullable field using mermaid syntax, `DateTime PropertyName "nullable"`. The ? mark should be removed and at the end of the line add the "nullable" descriptor. If the field is a key, then the PK/FK designation should come before the "nullable" tag, like `int FrequencyId FK "nullable"`
